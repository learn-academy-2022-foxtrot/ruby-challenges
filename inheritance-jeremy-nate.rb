# üêü Challenges: Animal Kingdom
# Read all stories before starting the challenge.

# As a developer, I can make a generic Animal class.
# As a developer, upon initialization, I can give my Animal a status of alive, 
# which will be set to true.
# As a developer, I can give my Animal an age of 0 upon initialization.
# As a developer, I can age my Animal up one year at a time.
# As a developer, I can return my Animal's age, as well as if they're alive.
# Hint: Use attr_accessor as well as an initialize method.

# üèî Stretch Goals
# As a developer, I can keep a collection of two of each Animal.
# Hint: You'll want to add your Animals into an array.
# As a developer, I can sort my collection of Animals based on age.
# Hint: Find out how the spaceship operator can help you with an array.
# As a developer, I can utilize a Ruby module to help DRY up my code. I can 
# create a swim method inside of my module that will apply to Animals who can 
# swim. This method should return "I can swim!"
# Hint: Look into module mix ins. Since not all animals can swim, only certain 
# Animals will have access to this module.
