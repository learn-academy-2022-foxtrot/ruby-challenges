# Create a method called sum_these_numbers which takes two integers as an argument and prints their sum to the screen.
# def sum_these_numbers(num1,num2)
#    p num1 + num2
# end

# sum_these_numbers(1,2)



# Create a method called is_even, which takes a single integer, and which then returns true if the number is even, and false otherwise.
# def is_even(num)
#     if num.even?
#         true
#     else
#         false

# Create a method that takes a number as an argument and prints "Valid" if the number is between 1 and 10 (inclusive) and "Invalid" otherwise.
# def between_one_and_ten(num)
#     if num >= 1 && num <= 10
#         puts 'valid'
