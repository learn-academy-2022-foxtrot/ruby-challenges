# 🐟 Challenges: Animal Kingdom
# Read all stories before starting the challenge.
# As a developer, I can make a generic Animal class.
# As a developer, upon initialization, I can give my Animal a status of alive, which will be set to true.
# As a developer, I can give my Animal an age of 0 upon initialization.
# As a developer, I can age my Animal up one year at a time.
# As a developer, I can return my Animal's age, as well as if they're alive.
# Hint: Use attr_accessor as well as an initialize method.
class Animal
    attr_accessor :title, :age, :health
    def initialize (title_param, age_param)
        @title = title_param
        @age = 0
        @health = true
    end
    def happy_birthday
        @age += 1
    end
    def get_age
        @age
    end
    def get_show_data
        if @age < 1
            "#{@title} is #{@age} years old and is alive!"
        else @age >= 2
            "#{@title} is #{@age} years old and has passed away :("
        end
    end

class Animal_1 < Animal
    def initialize(title_param, age_param, bloodtype_param)
        super(title_param, age_param)
        @bloodtype = bloodtype_param
    end

#output: #<Animal_1:0x0000000131855688 @title="Fish", @age=0, @health=true, @bloodtype="Cold Blooded">
# As a developer, I can create a Fish that inherits from Animal.
# As a developer, I can initialize all of my fish to be cold_blooded. (Yes, there is one fish who is technically fully warm-blooded but we aren't going to talk about that.)
# As a developer, I can create a Salmon that inherits from Fish.
# As a developer, I can initialize my Salmon to be a specific species (Atlantic, Sockeye, etc).
# As a developer, I can see that my Salmon is cold-blooded.
# As a developer, I can age my Salmon up.
# As a developer, I can see a message that tells me all of my Salmon's information.
# As a developer, if my Salmon reaches the ripe old age of 4, I can make it die peacefully after a full and happy life.
# Hint: You will need a method that changes the status of alive in the initialize method of Animal.
# As a developer, I can create a Mammal that inherits from Animal.
# As a developer, I can initialize all of my Mammals to be warm_blooded.
# As a developer, I can create a Bear that inherits from Mammal.
# As a developer, I can age my Bear up.
# As a developer, I can see a message that tells me all of my Bear's information.
# As a developer, if my Bear turns 20 years old, I can make it die peacefully after a full and happy life.
# Hint: You will need a method that changes the status of alive in the initialize method of Animal.
# As a developer, I can create a Mammal of my choice.
# As a developer, I can interact with the new Mammal via various methods.
# As a developer, I can see a message that tells me all of my new Mammal's information.
# 🏔 Stretch Goals
# As a developer, I can keep a collection of two of each Animal.
# Hint: You'll want to add your Animals into an array.
# As a developer, I can sort my collection of Animals based on age.
# Hint: Find out how the spaceship operator can help you with an array.
# As a developer, I can utilize a Ruby module to help DRY up my code. I can create a swim method inside of my module that will apply to Animals who can swim. This method should return "I can swim!"
# Hint: Look into module mix ins. Since not all animals can swim, only certain Animals will have access to this module.
