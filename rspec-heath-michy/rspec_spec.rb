# üèî Stretch Goals
# As a developer, I can add all of my Tasks to a TaskList.
# As a developer with a TaskList, I can print the completed items.
# As a developer with a TaskList, I can print the incomplete items.
# As a developer with a TaskList, I can list all the not completed items that are due today.
# As a developer with a TaskList, I can list all the incomplete items in order of due date.
# As a developer with a TaskList with and without due dates, I can list all the not completed items in order of due date, and then the items without due dates.
